Is there any way we can boost the operating speed of our current WMS system for data processing? 

Some of the screens have acceptable operating speeds – Mainly GR screens like ASN Receiving (Phase 2) & 
[1] Multi PO Pre-receipt Screen  

But some of the screens like New Order Entry Screen, Order Processing Screen, etc can take up considerable man hours.


I understand IT team has put in considerable effort like the recent “Identifying the Top 5 critical WMS screens for 
improvement”, splitting some of the screens to Archive & Production, troubleshooting the individual concerns by 
the ops daily, identifying the root causes for interfacing issues like the multiple line items transfer TX failure, 
daily WMS-SAP recon, pending enhancements, etc.

But we are still contributing to the effects of the root causes as evident from the yearly XSGT projects and 
costly cycle count liability. 

 
Data processing like GR, manual allocation & GI are ok after the above initiatives but in terms of data retrieval
involving use of Inventory Status, Order Information Query and screens involving the archive tick box, the waiting
time is still considerably long and will set to get longer as our business increases year after year. 


You can perhaps share some existing constraints that affect further improvements.

Is it due to our server is tapping on regional server and is subsequently costly to change? Or due to other reasons?
