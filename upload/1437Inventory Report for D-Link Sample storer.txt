Dear Lionel / Lim,

Kindly help to re-locate all the items received under D-Link Sample Storer to the same location in warehouse.

Please do complete the movement within this month.
After that, kindly generate the SCHSample Dlink daily inventory report by auto email every morning.

Thanks and regards
Jane
