Hi Meena,
Kindly find attached for a/m.
Pls help me to do the following:

From sku list (of pallet qty) and current inventory, I would like to know its EXPECTED pallet number (fyi, the current competitor tracks it inventory by CBM and hence there is no feasibility on pallet number
From the Pallet number list, catgeorise them into 2 types of pallet height; 2.2m and 1.6m
Throw out those sku that does not appear in the inventory list

Please let me know if you need more information
