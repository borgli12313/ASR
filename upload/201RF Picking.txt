In order to capture the picking in progress status in the existing WIP Report,the required milestone has to be available to provide this KPI marker.

In view of this, we would like to implement RF picking with the following in place.

1) RF Pick Screen should include:

- Wave key
- LP

Citeria:

- All information under a single wave should be scanned during picking before printing of case/part ID is allowed.

- For every wave, Picker should only be required to scan the wave number once followed by the scanning of all the relevant LPs to be picked under the wave. 

- There should be an immediate gate of check at the point of RF picking for any mismatch of LP against the LPs called under the wavekey.


2) Report to show the RF scanning summary for troubleshooting or checking purposes.



3) Additional Screen in WMS hub application to capture:

- Wave no.
- Scanning of employee's badge no. of the respective picker
