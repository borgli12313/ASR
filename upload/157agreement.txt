Hi Gui,

There are few notes that I need to bring it up to you as below before we
study/explore the IT Solution.

1. Before sending edi856 to you, System will get the PO# based on the SKU
and Plant (will not include SSKU, PO expiry date --> even though you're
sending to us, at our end it is just for reference only). Is it correct??

Gui ans : Yes .

2. System will not be able to handle duplicate records such as the same SKU
and Plant in one file. Is there such a scenario???
Gui ans : Are u refering to 1 sku , 1plant , multiple PO . This will not
happen .
1 Po will only relate to 1 SKU and 1 Plant .

3. The file you send to us must be in Tab-Delimetered. (Easier for IT
development and less time to develop). Is it ok??

Gui ans : No problem .

4. As you are aware that in our system there are possiblity having a same
sku but different format, for example:
1234-5678
@@1234-5678

Based on example above. Thus, the file you send to us, must include
1234-5678 and @@1234-5678 as well.
If not, how will the system identify which PO to use?? is it ok for you to
provide both SKUs???

Gui Ans : Already include all in the attachment file .

5. Since the file coming to you as the attachment through email, there will
be timing gap issue. For example as below:
8am - You send the email to us (with a new PO)
9am - edi856 triggered to you with the old PO
10am - edi856 triggered to you with the old PO
10:05am - we just read your email
10:10am - Upload the attachment to our system
11:00am - edi856 triggered to you with the new PO

edi856 at 9 and 10 am are still reflecting the old PO??? any concerns???

Gui ans : Timing gap for manual process is not preventable ,no concern for
me .
If we send file via FTP , I think that should be eliminate.

6. The sku with old PO has not been fully utilized, then a set of new PO
comes to us. Thus the system will send edi856 to you with the new PO. Any
concerns???

Gui ans: No concern .

7. Since we're going to develop this program, why not we cater this for SKU
mapping as well. The SKU mapping that you've asked to do in the past is a
manual process. So I suggest to make it fully auto process. But take note
of @@SKU must be provided as well.
If yes, can we have a SKU mapping format as well??

Gui ans: Complete mapping table as per attachment .
