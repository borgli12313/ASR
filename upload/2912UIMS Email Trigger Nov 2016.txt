         Currently when an UIMS request is approved,

            i) Approval Email :
                An approval Email is sent to the Application Administrators and Requestors.
                Not sure, if the eMail is sent to the Account Owner , if he has a valid DBSchenker.com email ID.

           i) Reject Email :
                Not sure, if the eMail is sent to the Account Owner , if he has a valid DBSchenker.com email ID.

                 Can you add  Account Owner also if he has valid email like  ‘XXX@dbschenker.com’.

           iii)  ID creation Email :

                  When an ID is created by an Administrator ( Example Exceed ),  an Email is triggered to the Requestor
                     With ID and PASSWORD.  

                     There is a change now as given below :

                       If the Account Owner has a valid email  then 

                  a)  An Email without  PW info should be sent to the Reporting TO manager and
                           to  Requestor ( if he is not the  Account Owner /Reporting TO ).

                   b) ID and PW shall be sent to the Account Owner
                           Add a sentence at the bottom of the Email body  
                          Note :  Dear Account Owner, Please change the password during the first Login’.

               If the Account Owner do not have an email  then 
 
                  c)   An Email  PW info should be sent to the Reporting To  manager.
                            Add a sentence at the bottom of the Email Body :

                            ‘Dear Manager,  Please protect the ID and PW information as this is for the requested account owner use only’

                d)   Sent an Email to  Requestor ( if he is not the  Account Owner/Reporting TO ) with the ID creation info without PW
