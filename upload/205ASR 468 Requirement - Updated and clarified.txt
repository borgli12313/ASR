Additional COO Column

i) Current
ASN created have COO populated as country reflected in PO header.
However, for DCs, different parts may have different COOs, hence not able to update COO at ASN receipt line level.


ii) Proposed
As per Epson request, we have to capture COO at line level. Input of the relevant COO should take 
place at the point of GIT (ASN creation) via the requested additonal COO Column. Upon receiving the invoice and 
packing list, the COO will be input at line level. 

If COO is not input by user into this column, it will take the default COO from PO header.


Overall Criteria:

The COO information at the point of GIT should still be based on the COO received from 
the 850. If a revised COO is input at the line level, the information would then overwrite the COO 
received from the 850 message, otherwise, the COO will remain as status quo.

Additional COO input column should be blank, which allows user to input the correct COO. If user does not key
in the COO, then it will take the COO from PO header and update the ASN.
