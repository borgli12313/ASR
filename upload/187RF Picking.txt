In order to capture the picking in progress status in the existing WIP Report,the
required milestone has to be available to provide this KPI marker.

1) RF Pick Screen should include:

- Wave no.
- Part no.
- LP

2) Additional Screen in WMS hub application to capture:

- Wave no.
- Scanning of employee's badge no. of the respective picker
