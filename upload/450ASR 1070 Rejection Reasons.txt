        Subject:        Fw: ASR Request - ReqNo: 1070 - WMS - Scoping 


Poh Sing, 

This request will not and cannot be addressed in the short to medium term for the following reasons: 

- e-Procurement as it is today does not support the charge to customer distinction among supplier invoices. 

- e-Procurement is now undergoing a redevelopment and is now at testing stage.  And it still does not support the "Charge To Customer" distinction. 

- SLIM interface with non-WMS system is not available. 

- the level of information support / entry needed at e-procurement yet to be discussed involving HR/Finance. 

Best regards
