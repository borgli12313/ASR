Corporate CQI system which is used for interstation complaints has the option of 
allowing station B to forward to C with A automatically notified. 
This is, in fact, the preferred mode so that origin station A does not get 
bogged down with rejections and resubmissions. 

Would like for BAX SIN CFMS to allow similar option for local management of 
complaints.
