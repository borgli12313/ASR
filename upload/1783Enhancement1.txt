Currently under the BOM Hub, Ops are not able to make direct / complete entries of part numbers in the SKU field.
Only the first digit/alphabet is allowed to be keyed and listing of available SKUs appeared in Sequence.
Taking a longer time to trace inventory and details of results not able to be copied/pasted.
Request to enhance the function.
