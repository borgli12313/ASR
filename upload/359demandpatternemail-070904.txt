Hello Jyhhuey

The current logic for Demand Pattern

1. List all the SKU in the master
2. For each of this SKU , checks the inventory in the
warehouse(qtyallocated-qtypicked-qtyonhold)
3. Calculates the value of the stock using the price list we receive from
RODEN. The value is SGD.
4. Calculates the number of countries ordering a particular SKU from day
one.
5. If the number of country ordering is 1, then , specify the countryname
6 .Calculate the open backorder qty for all the customer orders
7. Calculate the backorderqty from RODEN based on the qtyexpected in the
ASN minus the qtyreceived.
8. Calculating the quantity shipped in a trimester basis
9. Update the Min & Max quantity from Master.


Propose the following updation

1. List the SKU from Master with reference to the order list received from
JNJ to eliminate the obselete parts.
2. 2.For each of this SKU , checks the inventory in the
warehouse(qtyallocated-qtypicked-qtyonhold)
3. Calculates the value of the stock using the price list we receive from
RODEN. The value is SGD.
4. Calculates the number of countries ordering a particular SKU from day
one.for the past 12 months
5. To provide the list of Countries ordering ( Will need to work on how
complicated this would be)

Will revisit into the logic of the following points

6 .Calculate the open backorder qty for all the customer orders
7. Calculate the backorderqty from RODEN based on the qtyexpected in the
ASN minus the qtyreceived.
8. Calculating the quantity shipped in a trimester basis

Not required as we do not use it any more

9. Update the Min & Max quantity from Master.


Please discuss this with Mr. Pang and let me know on what is your idea to
enhance the report.

Thanks
Meena
