ASN screen to pop up error msg "eSMI Validation-Insufficient PO Quantity-32A000XXXX". 
The msg will be after the LA key in the total qty & click on save ASN#. 
The validation will base on PO qty against the daily PO file from HP. 
Rainbow able to auto minus the total qty received against the PO qty file from HP from time to time.
This will help to reduce the 102K signal to fusion.
