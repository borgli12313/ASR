For overlapping billing-period, Change the PERIOD and ECOMONTH based on the number of days 
Ex   1.    BIlling - Peiod
            START                 END                
        20-03-2010         03-04-2010     
          
          Since Mar has more days, 
                    EcoMonth = 201003 

2.    BIlling - Peiod         ( equal )

          START                 END                
        29-03-2010         03-04-2010     
               
          Since Mar has equal days as that of Ap
                    EcoMonth = 201003 
                    
                    PEriod       = 03


Other conditions ,   remain as that of current calculations.
