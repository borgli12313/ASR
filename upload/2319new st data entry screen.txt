Final stock take data entry screen:

Ops stopped using the RF driven stock take application in July 2014, 
now need to have a data entry screen in wms hub to input physical count data

data element to key in: MPN, LP, PHYQTY,PHYLOC,BATCH

data element to retrieve: 
SysLoc, SysLP  ,  SysQty  , SysAllocatedQty, SysBatch,SysMPN , UOM,    Lot

In this screen, non of the input element is mandatory for user to key in, 
however PHYLP, PHYQTY,PHYLOC are compulsory in stock take table, we can use 
dummy data when user do not key in the needed data:

E.g. LP99999999   as dummy lp
Loc  LOC9999999   as dummy loc
