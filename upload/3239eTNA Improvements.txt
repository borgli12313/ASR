eTraining Portal Improvements

1. Add In the function to search by course when approving the applications (Application Process -> Application Verification)

2. Allow L1 and L2 to see the submission status of their employees. (i.e. If I apply for my employee, I will be able to see the submission status of that application, e.g. pending L2 approval or pending HR approval)
