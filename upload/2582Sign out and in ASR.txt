1. Steps
- Scan countbook ID
- Scan Employee ID
- Auto show Employee Name
- Auto show Sign Out/In timing

2. Logic
- If there is no countbook printing, Sign Out is not allowed
- If there is no Sign Out, Sign In is not allowed
- If there is no Sign In, Data Entry is not allowed
- If there is no Data Entry, 2nd count/3rd count countbook is not allowed to be generated

3. Real-time Status Monitoring Board
- Horizontal axis shows counting teams
- Vertival axis shows the total and completed countbooks in each team in stacked bars.
- One chart for each count (count 1, 2 and 3)
