I realised that the inventory report being retreived in RABBIT includes qty such as pick, allocate or even on hold.

Pls help to change the logic to exclude all allocated and pick qty, showing available qty in one column and another column "on hold"

This will enable the user to know at one glance the available qty on hand at that point of time
