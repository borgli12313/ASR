ABC classification report requested to be automated,the schedule to be
finalised.
The columns requested

SKU   salesQty    Brand      BL          Classification

Logic to be built in,

1. 12  months of past  data from the day the report is generated.
2. Sales qty is the quantity shipped during the period
3. Sku's which forms the 70% of the total sales will be classified 'A'
4. Sku's which forms the 20% of the total sales will be classified 'B'
5. Sku's which forms the 10% of the total sales will be classified 'C'
6. Rest of the Sku's with sales qty <=52  will be classified 'E'


Modification required :-

1) SKU with qty less than 52 will be auto "E" class

2) This should exclude Cypher code : CRSxxxxx & CRAxxxxx

3) change title "sales %" to "% contribution" and in 2 dec. place and
another column for Cumulative %
