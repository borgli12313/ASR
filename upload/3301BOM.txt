When uploading new BOM file to WMS,
Change the logic of updating Parent Kit such that rather than WMS overwriting previous entry of SKU on an earlier line of the BOM file uploaded, 
It combines together with the previous entry to form the complete kit, so we can minimize missing SKUs in a parent part.
