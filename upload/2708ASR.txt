Dear Marian,

I need your help to patch the receiving data within SAP 0001 from backend, as there is an inventory discrepancy btw SAP & WMS.

ASN# 24042
SKU# 5198391

Line # 142 – over-assignment of 200pcs 
Line # 148 – under-assignment of 200pcs

Please patch the line tagging to LP0000350942 to line # 148 with dummy LP# D16012900059 ( Loc – STAGE). Thanks
