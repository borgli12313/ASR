TP

INBOUND

1. All receipt starting with DN is local,while those starting with IV and GIV are Overseas.
	Does this mean that we do not bother about all other receipts that does not start with DN/IV/GIV ???

     For TP, the manual ASN is without the prefix, these are to be under local supplies.Allan, Can you please help reconfirm.

2. Mode is all by Sea

3. Forwarder information: All are Non BAX
  
5. Frequency of shipment: 
	a.All manual ASN and DN(local)created in a day to be considered as 1 shipment/count for frequency.
                b.For Overseas, Each IV/GIV created to be considered as 1 shipment/count for frequency.

	So all reports classify data into the respective months based on ASN creation date ?????
Yes, the ASN date will decide the Month it should fall into.

OUTBOUND

1. All Orders with Ship to code = 'SG' to considered as Local and BAX deliver
2. All orders with Ship to code <> 'SG' to be considered Overseas.
