Additional COO Column

i) Current
Currently, all POs consist of a Country of Origin, which comes in thru the 850. During creation of ASN 
in the hub (through "Create Non-EMC ASN"), the ASN line is created with the COO from the PO. 
This implies that the COO is captured at PO level. 


ii) Proposed
As per Epson request, we have to capture COO at line level. Input of the relevant COO should take 
place at the point of GIT (ASN creation) via the requested additonal COO Column. Upon receiving the invoice and 
packing list, the COO will be input at line level. 


Overall Criteria:

The COO information at the point of GIT should still be based on the COO received from 
the 850. If a revised COO is input at the line level, the information would then overwrite the COO 
received from the 850 message, otherwise, the COO will remain as status quo.

Plse do not make the COO information available at the front end screen. The COO column should serve as 
an editing function.
