Inside the ASN Creation screen, under the RMA tab, the user has to add in additional lines if needed & then key in all the fields. Most of the fields for every line are the same. Can we automatically populate the same info from the previous line so that the user will modify them instead of keying all of them? This will save effort as there are tens/ hundreds of lines to key in with most having the same info.
